{"label": "1", "text": "As a teacher and lover of History , and Social Science I do understand the importance and beauty of freedom of press , mind and opinion . Mr. Bloom shows the reader the ugly side of this in this mass of pessimism . If he has intended it to motivate America youth , he has failed . If he intended it for the reader to enjoy , he failed .

Shame on you Allan Bloom !"}
