{"label": "2", "text": "I have read several of Lee books . He has a very good formula , and I find his style and content very entertaining . I believe it is a shame that Tom Cruise was cast as Jack in the new movie entitled Jack Reacher . Lee has gone to great effort to build the character as a large , muscular man who is not partucularly physically attractive , but very fit , and intelligent . Tom Cruise simply does not sell as this character . I think the casting director of the movie should be fired ."}

This usually involves violence and death and trying to outdo the Flash in speed . Not good ."}

At this point I had lost faith in BoxWave and did not want to take the risk of spending another $ 20 and not have it work .

Frey attempts to work in too many plot lines , his poorly developed characters have no substance other than to assure that they function best as whiny spoiled children .

Had I a selection of other books from which to choose ( or could have found a passenger willing to trade ) , I would have set this book aside without temptation to learn the ending .

{"label": "2", "text": "Here is the CD that sets the mood for romance . The only reason this album is added to my collection is the flavor of Rod Stewart romantic hits of the 1990s . If We Fall In Love Tonight , For the First Time , Have I Told You Lately and All For Love are some of those hits that are not available in any of Stewart greatest hits albums . Stewart also included some revival songs for his version of When I need You ( Leo Sayer ) and Sometimes When We Touch ( Dan Hill ) , which are also sensational . The rest are standard songs that can be found in his other albums especially in his Storyteller collection , which I also have . All in all , the dedication that is put in the creation of this album is outstanding . Stewart has made numerous hits and this collection narrows down to the romantic ballads of the past three decades . Nicely done ."}

Okay , maybe three , if your middle sentence is a two word sentence fragment : `` gratuitous sex '' . The writing is weak . The characters are either underdeveloped , or their decisions are unfathomable . I felt like it was two in the morning and I was watching a `` B '' movie on Skinamax .

No spoiler , but one mission takes place in the White House . Right , no trouble sneaking in there.The rest of missions do not follow any real story like HM2 but use the choppy action sequence approach that , unlike Contracts , are not even entertaining .

Why these guys were not as popular like The Eagles is still one of the great mysteries of the 70 s ! ! There are 3 bonus tracks on this cd version : `` Sweetwood '' is one of them and is one of the best ballads ever to have been released by The Ozarks . Talking about quality control ....... this track was never released until now ! ! So once again ......... go out and buy this album ! ! ! PS ; Some more good news ; The CBS album from 1980 will als be released by the good people of New Era in november 2005 ! Greetings to all Ozark fans , Martin from Holland"}
