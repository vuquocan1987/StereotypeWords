{"label": "1", "text": "As a teacher and lover of History , and Social Science I do understand the importance and beauty of freedom of press , mind and opinion . Mr. Bloom shows the reader the ugly side of this in this mass of pessimism . If he has intended it to motivate America youth , he has failed . If he intended it for the reader to enjoy , he failed . In my opinion , and that of many of my colleagues , Allan Bloom is a bitter , hate filled man , with nothing better to do than write a biography of America downfalls , ignoring all of the advantages that coincide . Shame on you Allan Bloom !"}
{"label": "1", "text": "This movie took a fascinating topic , and made it boring . The acting was bland , the screenplay was trite , and the directing was amateurish . It was a made for tv movie , that really was not even up to tv movie standards . At just a little over an hour , there was little time to develop the characters . I have read several books about this man , who was called The Morman Manson . This should have been interesting , but I was bored after about 20 minutes . I only finished watching it because my husband wanted to see how it ended . He really did not like it either though ."}
{"label": "2", "text": "I received my dvd and I was able to complete two of the segments in the dvd . I did the crosstrain and a different one . I noticed I was out of breath shortly after the first segment . I love the 10 minute solution dvd series but , I feel that more time should be put in the warm up and cool-down without taking away from the segment . my suggestion would be to have a warm-up segment and cool-down segment each 3-4 minutes in duration . I believe this will reduce any injury that may befall an individual . I am almost 40 years old and I know I have to do my own warm-up session before any ten minute solution workout as well as a cooldown both 4-5 minutes or more . Overrall wonderful dvd and Cute Gloves I love pink . I have a long way to go as far as my weight goes , so any time saving fitness dvd can help : ) ."}

{"label": "2", "text": "Antonio Carluccio is clearly an aficionado , from collecting to preparing , he shows us how to honor the magic of fungi . This is not just a cookbook , the first half of the book covers foraging and collecting , with clear descriptions and pictures of each mushroom and it is troublesome look alikes . The second half is devoted to great recipes designed to really show off each mushroom particular flavor and texture . Rare is the chef who can throttle back his `` chops '' to let the delicate flavor of each fungi be the star . `` If you ca not taste it , you waste it '' does not apply to Carluccio recipes.As a 15+ year forager and obsessed amateur chef , I feel confident in recommending this book highly to anyone who wants to know how to get the most out of their mushrooms ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "I played Halo and loved it . I played Halo 2 and kind of enjoyed it . I skipped Halo 3 and went right to Halo : ODST and enjoyed that . Now , I finally came back to Halo 3 and all I have to say is `` What a snooze-fest ! '' I was dismayed at the boring levels that frequently gave no indication as to where you needed to go . I was perplexed by the `` who cares ? '' plot line that seemed to only be created in order to make further use of the Flood ( which are really annoying as far as video game zombies are concerned ) . I only finished the game so that I could get it over with and learn how the trilogy of games concludes , as each level of Halo 3 was less and less compelling than the previous one and some of the Flood levels were downright incomprehensible as to where to go and what to do . To be sure , I liked ODST and play the Firefight mode with friends all the time . But this game is about as exciting as Pariah was for the old Xbox . Fair warning !"}

I am hearing such incredible clarity in some older CD that I swear I have never heard before . I am very very happy indeed . The main complaint that I read of them being heavy has yet to bother me . I find them very comfortable and am so overwhelmed by the sound that I almost forget they are there . Truly a great product to own ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "I could not get it to work properly under Windows XP , even after downloading XP drivers from ATI website . One problem was that everytime I pluged it into my laptop , I had to reboot the comptuer , which it should not have had to do . However , the reason I sent it back was that the sound would go out after a few minuets , and I would have to change channels to get the sound back . The picture quality is also much worse than a tv tuner that goes into a PCI slot , which is expect because USB cables can not transfer as much data as PCI cards.If you have a desktop , I would recomend a PCI tv tuner or one that directly connects to the monitor and does not need a computer to work.It is possible that the sound and USB problems were because of XP compatablity issues . However , I gave this two stars because ATI does advertise it as XP compatable , and the poor picture quality was because of the tuner , not the computer ."}

This book really helps put what occurred in perspective . The author makes an effort not to take sides , but also does not shy from opining on how different parties and individuals could have handled events better . Keep in mind that since the author was a New York Times writer and not a political official or other Nicaraguan , the book never feels like a `` insider '' perspective .

The characters are , for the most part , interesting and engaging . Having said that , though , I must say that I find the novel milieu , upper class society , a very interesting subject matter.In the end , the book suffers several flaws . It is so obviously influenced by Gatsby . Whole scenes from Fitzgerald famous novel seem to have been lifted and modernized . And the characters all have parallels . Kate is Daisy . Harry is Gatsby . Geroge is Nick Carraway . Etc ... Despite the flaws , the novel is poignant in parts and well worth reading ."}

{"label": "2", "text": "I am taking organic chemistry right now , so I thought it would be a good idea for me to buy this model set . Some of the reviews said that a single set does not contain enough pieces , so I bought two just in case ... I ended up not needing it that much in the fall semester , but that was more due to my learning style than anything else . When I did use it I had SO MUCH FUN . I felt like a nerdy little kid again , and it was awesome.In all seriousness , I would not use this set on an exam because it takes a little while to put the pieces together and take them apart , but for homework problems involving molecules that you just ca not visualize ( especially tricky stereochemistry problems ) , it is really helpful . We will see if I use it more for organic chemistry this spring , or for inorganic chem next year.My only real complaint is that even with two sets you ca not make buckminsterfullerene ... you need 60 carbons for that ... : ("}

Granted , it took me longer to get a feel for this one then say Dark side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here .It really is underrated and under appreciated . I encourage all Pink Floyd fans and newcomers to give this a try without comparing it too much to Floyds past . Gilmour and crew deserve a chance.AMLOR manages to capture the essence of Pink Floyd nicely without Waters involvement . In fact , I would say the remaining band members have managed to recapture some of there creative essence featured in their earlier material that was lost as the turmoil in the band grew ."}
