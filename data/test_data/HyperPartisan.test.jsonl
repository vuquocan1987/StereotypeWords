{"label": "false", "text": "WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - The White House initially said Trump fired Comey over his handling of the Hillary Clinton private email server investigation, however, later the US president stated that when he decided to dismiss Comey, he was thinking of the Russia investigation. US President Donald Trump said in a statement on Thursday that he did not fire former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey because of the Russia investigation. Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia! The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true! In an interview with NBC News' Lester Holt in May 2017, Trump said he was thinking about \"this Russia thing\" when he decided to fire Comey. READ MORE: Twitter on Fire as Comey Strikes Back at Trump \"Lying\" About FBI Comey's firing ultimately led to the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate allegations of Russian interference into the 2016 election and collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign. Russian officials have repeatedly denied allegations of interference, calling the accusations groundless and absurd. Trump has also denied any collusion with the Kremlin and has called Mueller's investigation \"a witch hunt.\""}
{"label": "true", "text": "In his election campaign, Mr Trump was clear about his desire to build a \"great great\" wall along the border of the US and Mexico which he believes will bring an end to illegal immigration from South and Central America. LBC presenter Ian Collins received a call from Mexican Josephine, who explained why she could not wait for work to begin on the wall. Josephine believes people from her native country are victimised because the Mexican government does not do enough for their people and have no authority when it comes to handling crime, especially in relation to drugs. She said: \u201cWe get the blame for all these criminals. \u201cThe Mexican government has turned a blind eye and the war has been lost with the drugs. \u201cMany areas of Mexico have become worse than Chicago. \u201cPeople are shooting themselves... they look after their family and they have machine guns and they drive around in trucks.\u201d Collins then asked: \u201cSo you\u2019re saying Donald Trump wasn\u2019t being a racist then? I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth I just want to be clear.\u201d Tue, December 13, 2016 \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Josephine replied. Since becoming President-elect has reiterated his intention to crack down on immigration. Speaking to CBS in his first major interview since being elected Mr Trump said: \u201cWhat we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably two million \u2013 it could be even three million \u2013 we are getting them out of the country or we are going to incarcerate.\u201d Collins, attempting to understand why the Mexican woman was so pleased about Mr Trump\u2019s election success, said: \u201cWas he saying something that lots of people think but are too scared to say?\u201d Josephine said: \u201cYes, and another thing is that I love the people that are here that I know, I know many people that are Asians, that are Arabs, good speaking English people, but there are very few. \u201cThe most people in the area don\u2019t want to mix, and they are very hostile. \u201cEverything has been twisted. I have scrutinised everything in this campaign and newspapers said today he is getting rid of three million migrants. \u201cBut they missed a word. Trump said \u2018illegal criminals\u2019.\u201d"}
