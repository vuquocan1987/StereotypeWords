At a rally in Greensboro, N.C., Trump said these accusations are part of a conspiracy involving the Clinton campaign and what he called \u201cthe corrupt media.\u201d Greg Gutfeld agreed with much of Trump's assessment on \"The Five\" today, saying, \"The media wants Hillary to win. There's no doubt about that.\" Judge Jeanine on Trump Accusers: 'All on One Day? It's a Little Too Convenient' Gutfeld explained that Trump has actually been \"set up,\" as he was given countless hours of coverage and \"billions of dollars of free media,\" only to have the rug pulled out from under him. \"The media ... [and] Hillary and Obama, they knew elevating Donald Trump - giving him an air of respectability in the press, as well - turned him into the Republican nominee. Then, out came the knives.\" Watch the co-hosts of \"The Five\" discuss above, and let us know what you think in the comments.

Once again, Trump has told his gullible supporters that we are letting people in by the thousands who are not vetted and that we don\u2019t know who they are. Refugees must first apply to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which collects documents and performs interviews. Less than 1 percent of refugees get approved for relocation. If they are approved, they are referred to the State Department to begin the vetting process. More information is collected and they are put through security screenings from the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.

There, interviews with USCIS officers would take place and fingerprints run through biometric databases of the FBI, Homeland Security and Department of Defense. If all these are passed, health screenings take place. Then refugees are enrolled in cultural orientation classes while information continues to be checked. This process typically takes 18 to 24 months after applying to the UN. This is the most vigorous vetting anyone has ever faced to enter the U.S. Donald Trump is trying to instill fear in the gullible supporters that he has. He has lied about his health records, his tax returns, President Obama\u2019s birth certificate, election fraud (31 cases of voter impersonation in over 1 billion votes) and hundreds of other things, and those who choose to believe him either don\u2019t care about his lies or aren\u2019t smart enough to find out the truth for themselves.
