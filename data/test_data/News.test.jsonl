{"label": "COMP.WINDOWS.X", "text": "From: doug@foxtrot.ccmrc.ucsb.edu (Douglas Scott) Subject: Help with porting screensaver function  This is a question aimed at those who have done some server code hacking:    I am attempting to add a working SaveScreen function to a new server.  I have been able to get the screen to blank out properly, and through debugging I can see that my savescreen function is being called with on=0, which (for some arcane reason) means to blank the screen.  My problem is that this function is never being called again with on=1, even after I have moved the mouse and/or typed some keys.  My question is:  what am I likely to be missing that would cause this problem?  I copied the basic design of my function from the existing versions:  static Bool next_savescreen(scr,on) ScreenPtr scr; Bool on; {    /* this was copied from the omron server code -- is it the right way? */   if (on != SCREEN_SAVER_ON) {   nextSetLastEventTime();   }    if (on == SCREEN_SAVER_ON) { /* Save user's current setting */   next_save_screen_brightness = NXScreenBrightness(my_eventhandle);   NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle, 0.0); /* Blank the screen */   }   else {            /* Unblank the screen */   NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle, next_save_screen_brightness);   }    return TRUE; }  I can see in the server/os code where the screensaver is called to turn on the saver, but I cannot find where it \"wakes up\" the server and unblanks the screen.

There was a > demand, so an entire industry formed to supply it.   If alcohol were again banned today, it would be MUCH more  difficult to manage a large-scale smuggling operation.   The cops now rank just a narrow notch below the military  in communications, intelligence gathering and firepower.   In a similar vein, the amount of marijuana smuggled into  this country has greatly decreased. This is because its  value-per-pound is very low when compared to cocaine or  heroin. It's simply not worth the risk, it's uneconomical.  Now, most reefer is domestic. There is less pressure on  the domestic producer (showy raids notwithstanding) and  thus it is economical. Of note though ... domestic reefer  is now very strong, so a small volume goes a long way.  You cannot make alcohol stronger than 200 proof - not a  good dollar/pound deal.    Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area.  It would not be economic to smuggle them in. All production  would have to be local. There are not all that many people  who have both the skill AND motivation to assemble worthwhile  firearms from scratch. High-ranking crime figures could  obtain imported Uzis and such, but the average person, and  average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun - and would  pay through the nose for it.  "}

One reply, which I have lost, suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses, one  of which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan.  By coincidence, last week's _America_, the national Jesuit magazine, carried an interview with Fr. Myles  Bourke, Corpus Christi's pastor emeritus.  Fr. Bourke also directed the NT  translation in the New American Bible.  He noted \"...certain practices have  been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality,  and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy.\"  I note that at my  parents' parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the  offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word \"risen\".  This was not a  kiddie mass, either, but the well-attended 11:00 Mass.  I wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies.  This newsgroup as a whole offers generally moderate (perhaps because it's moderated) conversation on topics that often lead people to extreme behavior (including myself).
