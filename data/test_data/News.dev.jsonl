Actually, I find Limbaugh's oratory less than sizzling and his debating skills sometimes lacking, even though his conclusions are often correct.  I would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated  political power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the \"right\" things (where \"right\" is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement) is showing an acute case of \"myopic social perspective\", not to mention arrogance and utter stupidity.  Limbaugh is certainly far from perfect, but his opponents in the established body politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of virtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry, and for the elimination of local control over Affairs Public.    Perhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated  like errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic  people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the \"oughta-be's\" inside their own hopelessly closed minds.    >        The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening  >pages of both books.

I have read Mr. Limbaugh's book, and although it was not the most literary piece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain \"venom\" at all, let alone \"venom\" comparable to an individual who callously murdered millions out of racism.    >On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society >        Hitler: \"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who  >individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly  >perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in  >order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of  >imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight  >for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of  >thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\"  >(page 577).

It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media  >will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking  >and screaming all the way.\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)  You neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show,  BTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather than blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention  that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions. He also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much). This is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is treated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator.  I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just kidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and needed to be exterminated.    >On Religion as the Basis of a Nation >        Hitler: \"In this world human culture and civilization are  >inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his  >decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without  >culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord  >sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the  >expulsion from Paradise.\" (Page 581.)  This is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since Christ was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of the Aryan as \"the highest image of the Lord\" fits with Christian doctrine.    >        Limbaugh: \"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ...  >But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or  >ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a  >charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools  >for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of  >American education has declined ever since?\" (pages 274-5.)  Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than publicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo- Christian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent to Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching just a wee bit here.    >On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse >        Hitler: \"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ...  >One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and  >theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ...  >Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays  >must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the  >service of a moral idea of State and culture.\" (pages 346 and 348.)  Definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment industry here.   >        Limbaugh: \"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that  >Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people  >who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality  >and monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\" (page 254.)  Just a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate government control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show to confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the depraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control  of Hollywood.  90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control  of our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an early age the \"right\" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr.  Limbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the \"young heads full of mush\" hyperbole indicates.    >On the News Meida >        Hitler: \"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of  >gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass  >by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the  >people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of  >slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews.\" (Page 331.)  Pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for government power to be used to break up the conspiracy.    >        Limbaugh: \"Elements of The Media have jumped on the  >bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been  >replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ...

If they don't  >realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that  >therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided  >and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania.\" (pages 270 and 268.)  Indication here that \"Elements of the Media\" (since career is a self-selected categorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in the populace at large') has a leftist bias.  Doesn't sound too unreasonable. No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.  You may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable  opinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his  audience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that  purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree  or other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who  is being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?  Again, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would oppose government control of the media.    >*     *     *          >To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but  >ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.  It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance. Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people who disagree with them.  Why don't you challenge conservative ideology on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons? Perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that they exist in your mind, not the real world.    >        After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that  >haunts me.

Perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve Rush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading laughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.  As to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings. Mr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend of government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism in America through \"business/government partnership\" and increased levels of taxation.

Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler because he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of racism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to racism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear  racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal  Left.  The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked on the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized Education, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to  that Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear to me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush  Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than  the other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.   >The Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701- >0845; (608) 255-4460. > >--- 30 ---  This is the same address as \"Idiots Anonymous\", isn't it?

I am specifically interested in racing bikes, (CBR ;600 F2, GSX-R 750).  I know that this may sound kind of crazy ;considering that I've never had a bike before, but I am responsible, a ;fast learner, and in love.    Responsible and in love?  I believe that's a contradiction in terms.  Unless you're really brave (read: \"reckless\") a 500cc sport bike will go way faster than you dare for at least your first year of riding.  Getting more than that really is overkill, as you'll never even want to use it.  The following bikes can be bought (and repaired!) cheaply, are easy for a novice to manage, and are plenty high performance:     Kawasaki EX-500     Honda VF-500 \"Interceptor\"     Suzuki GS-550E  The 0-100mph time of the EX-500 at full throttle is \"way sooner than you're ready for it\".  :-)  With something as small as a 250, you'd probably be wishing for more power pretty quickly (unless it's a TZR or RGV :).  Now, I'm not saying that you're 100% certain to kill yourself immediately with a 600f2 or a GSXR-750.  Plenty of people have started riding on those bikes and done just fine.  What I am saying is that it's a waste of money, and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you drop the thing learning how to balance while stopping. You'll never get the throttle more than half open anyway, so why spend the extra 2000 bucks?  --- chris "}

There is another useful method based on Least Sqyares Estimation of the sphere equation parameters.  The points (x,y,z) on a spherical surface with radius R and center (a,b,c) can be written as      (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = R^2  This equation can be rewritten into the following form:       2ax + 2by + 2cz + R^2 - a^2 - b^2 -c^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2  Approximate the left hand part by   F(x,y,z) = p1.x + p2.x + p3.z + p4.1  For all datapoints, i.c. 4, determine the 4 parameters p1..p4 which minimise the average error |F(x,y,z) - x^2 - y^2 - z^2|^2.  In 'Numerical Recipes in C' can be found algorithms to solve these parameters.  The best fitting sphere will have  - center (a,b,c) = (p1/2, p2/2, p3/2) - radius R = sqrt(p4 + a.a + b.b + c.c).  So, at last, will this solve you sphere estination problem, at least for the most situations I think ?.  Quick van Rijt, rytg7@fel.tno.nl    "}

Since neither side would be particularly interested in telling the truth, you have to weigh the 'facts' given by each yourself, and weigh it with the newsreporting if you care.  Many cult members will probably side with the attorney, and if he is lying, change their stories to match his.  And if the Feds also lie, the cult members who become disillusioned will change their stories to match the Feds.    Neither sides are interested in the truth.  The Media is more interested, but usually either don't have the time to get it straight or tie themselves to the ratings and deliberately distort.    For me, though, the black soot billowing outside the compound added with how fast the fire spread ponted to *someone* dousing large parts of the compound with some sort of gasoline or fire-starter.  I doubt the Feds did that as they were more interested in arresting Vernon.  The real unbalanced one (at least the one that lost his cool) was Vernon, so I figured that he was more likely to do it (after all he was Jesus  being persecuted by the authorities, and had followers to hold onto, so made the decision.  He and his followers also probably felt that they were rocketing to heaven by doing this stuff).  Thsi conclusion, I came to after umpteen million hours of listening to NPR and other radio shows (I always have the radio going when I am in my office on some innocuous talk-show or news program as background noise).   --  <><><><><><><><><><> Personal opinions?

Simon P. Worden,                      The Deputy for Technology, SDIO                                                        Mcdonnell Douglas - Huntington Beach                               April 3,1993       Most of you, as am I, are \"children of the 1960's.\"  We grew up in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles, nuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were miracles of our parent's doing.  For a decade and more the pundits have told us - \"you've lost it!\"  The \"me\" generation is only living on the accomplishments of the past.       You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living history they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell of it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as General Bernie Schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle - to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.       What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand dollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only of that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen. Schriever's ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the best new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and Poseidon ballistic missiles.       Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing.  This event is proof.  To our technological parents: We've listened to your stories.  We've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit.  And we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus behind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest engineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your insight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated into today's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.       You told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - a single stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You advocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are all great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You convinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld its components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a prime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the generation before you - the generation that built transcontinental aviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a little and Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who started this program for the SDI.       Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't even start with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a little - even sold a little and made a little money - before they moved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or more before putting the first \"rubber on the road.\"  Max Hunter - you didn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going to take ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable aerospace transportation is real.       We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same team here today but a few years to show through the Strategic Defense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us - launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about a year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet Union.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored the importance of our work in bringing about a new international relationship.       But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the next generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.       We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three years a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space rapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And yes - we'll make a little money off it too!       Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of space will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries.  What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to counter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars!       To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to the final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't Saturn V's!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital system - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the way.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket exhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the world again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at hand!       This project is real.  The torch of American technological greatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine is American.  Let's go fly it! "}
