{"label": "false", "text": "Rumors that Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are allegedly on the verge of divorce have been circulating as early as a few weeks into their marriage. New reports claimed that there is a new woman involved in Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's alleged rocky relationship and it's none other than Jen's close friend, Chelsea Handler. Is the former \"Friends\" star jealous because her new husband and her pal are getting too close? Quite the opposite. A source claimed that Justin allegedly can't stand Chelsea and her antics. \"Recently, Justin came home to find Chelsea cooking breakfast in their kitchen ... completely naked,\" Celeb Dirty Laundry reported. \"Chelsea hates wearing clothes, and she documents her naked adventures on social media all the time.\" \"But Justin Theroux has forbidden her from having any more naked romps in his house while he is out of town,\" the report continued. According to an insider, Chelsea Handler was allegedly just trying to be funny. Unfortunately, Justin Theroux wasn't laughing. Apparently, Theroux confronted Aniston about her friend and how she irritates him. \"Chelsea thought it was hilarious, but Justin was really annoyed. Apparently Jen got in the habit of inviting Chelsea over for boozy girls' nights whenever he was away filming,\" OK! Magazine reported, as quoted by CDL. \"It bugged him to come home and find Chelsea there and the house a mess, but he bit his tongue. But now that he and Jen are married, he is establishing some ground rules, chief among them is that Chelsea is no longer welcome in their guest room,\" the report said. It has been previously reported that the newly weds are allegedly having problems over Jennifer Aniston being jealous because of Justin's purported closeness with his \"The Leftovers\" co-star, Margaret Qualley. The newlyweds' friends are hoping that the couple work out their differences especially since the couple is allegedly in the process of adopting a baby."}
