She is clearly in over her head now . What a shame she could not stick to a format in which she excelled and warmed the hearts of millions of readers.This just goes to show that one should figure out where one excels and stick to it . This is pure `` Peter Principle '' in action.Too bad or"}

{"label": "1", "text": "As someone who is studies emotions and decision making , I was looking forward to reading this book . While the author offers ( and repeats , and repeats ) considerable anecdotal evidence for animal emotion , there is little concrete science to support the claims.Furthermore , the field of emotion-cognition study in humans is still coming into its own and has grown exponentially since 1996 . Indeed , we now understand many human emotions better than in 1996 . Naturally , when comparing humans and animal emotions , these advances dramatically change our understanding and therefore draw into question many of the inferences made in the book.Not a great book to begin with . However , a decade after its release , it is borderline useless ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "Yea dont make me laugh , best rapper alive ? ? Yea f * cking right ! First of all cash money is THE stupidest name for a rap group ever , even though it does accurately describe the greed and ignorance it spreads like a wildfire through its music . Though i hav to admit Lil Wayne IS the best rapper in cash money ( which really doesnt say anything at all when u look at the competition ) . His lyrics are all about the 4 big things in commercial rap these days , ( money , cars , women and jewlery ) . Man if Tupac , Big L and Biggie were still alive there wouldnt be clowns like this around . If you want to know the REAL best hip hop albums of 04 pick up Madvillainy , 4th Dimensional Rocketship Going Up , Viktor Vaughn 2 and Murs 3:16 .

{"label": "1", "text": "I am a big fan of Omar Faruk Tekbilek . His recording with Brian Keane Beyond The Sky is the finest Middle Eastern instrumental recording ever made that I am aware of . After so many great CDs like FireDance , Beyond The Sky , Mystical Garden , and Crescent Moon , this CD is a major let down . One Truth just does not possess nearly the musicianship , passion , or even recording quality of his earlier releases . I hope that Omar Faruk can rebound from this , his very worst record , and return to making the incredible genre standard setting recordings that he has made in the past . I would advise anybody considering buying this CD to spend your money more wisely on any of his other earlier CDs ."}

The S710a has an absolutely gorgeous screen and the digital camera actually takes pretty decent pictures unlike all other picture camera phones that litterally look like junk . I highly recommend the S710a to anyone who looking for a full-featured cell phone in a good lookin outter shell .

She comes to the discovery that while blood binds , love strikes like lightning . You will say to yourself how beautiful when you finally put it down [ this is one you ca not put down until you finish ] . Ms Marillier has burst onto the Fantasy genre with pens blazing , and a skill to capture the reader that I rarely find ."}

Kimble escapes by the skin of his teeththe joy and genius of this incredible TV show is that although you know exactly what going to happen , it is still exciting and watchable . The whole 129 episodes ! In my opinion , its still the very best U.S TV series ever made and years ahead of its time . An absolute pleasure to watch for all ages .
