{"label": "1", "text": "I ordered this twice in the last year from Amazon and after six months the disc no longer plays on my surround sound system , my stereo or my car stereo . They seem to only last six months . I have ordered a third copy from another vendor that claims to ships from the factory . As this is one of my favorites , I am quite irritated at having to order the disc over and over . I will update you as to the quality of new disc when it comes in . I positively hate putting a negative review on anything associated with my favorite artist and want to reiterate that this complaint is as to condition only - not content ."}

After hearing the song in my head for over thirty years , I managed to locate it on Amazon a few weeks ago ( wonderful benefits of modern technology ) . I love Flora Purim voice , and the lyrics are beautiful . I am not a huge jazz fan , but I listen to this song over and over ."}
